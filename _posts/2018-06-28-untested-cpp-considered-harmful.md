I recently wrote an article about software testing. It was my contribution to the 'Advanced C++ programming' seminar that I chose as an elevtive for my master's degree in Computational Engineering.

#### Abstract:

After a motivation of software testing in section 1, both from the perspective of science and engineering, a short overview of different types of testing methods is given in section 2. In section 3 the use of unit testing frameworks is motivated, followed by an outline of their basic structure in section 4. The C++ software library Catch2 is introduced as an example in section 5. The ideas behind Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development are briefly presented in section 6 and section 7, respectively. Section 8 deals with the question of how to write testable code. An emphasis is put on synergies with other goals of software engineering.

As always, feel free to reach out and give me some feedback.
