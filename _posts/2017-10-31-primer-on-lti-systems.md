I recently wrote a small primer on Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems.
The text comes in the form of a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook including some code and figures.

You can open the notebook with the help of a cloud service called binderhub:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MarkusLohmayer/LTI-tutorial/master?filepath=LTI-tutorial.ipynb)

If you are interested in the files you can find the git repository [here](https://github.com/MarkusLohmayer/LTI-tutorial).

I would say that this notebook contains quite a bit of what I learned when studying [mechatronics enigineering as a Bachelor at FAU](https://www.mechatronik.studium.fau.de).
