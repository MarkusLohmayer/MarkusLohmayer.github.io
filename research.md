**Title**:
Towards a port-Hamiltonian approach to study Stirling-cycle devices

**Keywords**:
Port-Hamiltonian systems theory,
Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics (GENERIC framework),
Stirling-cycle devices,
Renewable Energy

**Abstract**:
Energy conversion devices
which are based approximately on the Stirling cycle
comprise
`engines'
which can use low-temperature heat sources
such as solar thermal energy and industrial waste heat
as well as
`refrigerators'
which can be used for air-conditioning.
Currently, these devices are not very popular
but they could play an important role in
dealing with global challenges
such as pollution and climate change.
Port-Hamiltonian systems theory
provides a modular approach
to modeling physical systems.
These systems are defined
based on a geometric object
called Dirac structure
which encodes the exchange of power between different
aspects of the system.
Port-Hamiltonian systems are naturally passive
making them attractive representations of
complex systems arising from
network modeling
as well as
modeling of distributed parameter systems.
Their structural properties turn out to be useful
for accurate numerical computations,
model generation, model simplification,
optimization and control.
In order to apply this theory
to nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems
such as Stirling-cycle devices,
a previously mentioned connection to
the GENERIC framework is explored in this thesis.
By using the total exergy as a Hamiltonian function
irreversible and reversible processes
can be modeled on an equal footing.
The structure of GENERIC port-Hamiltonian systems
ensures that
the reversible dynamics conserve the exchanged exergy and
the irreversible dynamics destroy some of the exchanged exergy.
A simple lumped-parameter example shows how
the graphical modeling language of bond graphs
can be used to represent GENERIC port-Hamiltonian systems.
% Software (28 words)
Simulation results are obtained
based on a software implementation
which automatically turns equations into results.
Manually writing problem-specific code
is avoided by leveraging
symbolic computation and code generation.
